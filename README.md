## Summary

The primary goal was to implement a few basic functions: add new items to the list, cross items out, delete items, and reload any remaing items from local storage when the page reloads.  I also made sure that the status of each item (completed or !completed) was stored and displayed accurately upon reloading.

I really enjoyed tying all of this together: modifying the DOM, events, and local storage.  Building this definitely added a few tricks to my tool bag.
